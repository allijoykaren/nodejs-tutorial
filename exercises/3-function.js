// Exercise: Function Creation

// 1. Create a function called `greet` that takes in a name as a parameter and returns a greeting message.
//    For example, if the name is "John", the function should return "Hello, John!".

// 2. Create a function called `calculateArea` that takes in the length and width of a rectangle as parameters
//    and returns the area of the rectangle. The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is length * width.

// 3. Create a function called `isEven` that takes in a number as a parameter and returns true if the number is even,
//    and false otherwise. Hint: You can use the modulus operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 2.

// 4. Create a function called `capitalize` that takes in a string as a parameter and returns the same string with
//    the first letter capitalized. For example, if the string is "hello", the function should return "Hello".

// 5. Create a function called `reverseArray` that takes in an array as a parameter and returns a new array with
//    the elements in reverse order. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3], the function should return [3, 2, 1].

// 6. Create a function called `getAverage` that takes in an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the average
//    of the numbers. Hint: You can use the reduce() method to sum up the numbers in the array, and then divide by
//    the length of the array to get the average.

// 7. Create a function called `isPalindrome` that takes in a string as a parameter and returns true if the string
//    is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and false otherwise. Ignore spaces and punctuation
//    when checking for palindromes.

// 8. Create a function called `getFactorial` that takes in a number as a parameter and returns the factorial of
//    that number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.
//    For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

// 9. Create a function called `countVowels` that takes in a string as a parameter and returns the number of vowels
//    in the string. Vowels are the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (both lowercase and uppercase).

// 10. Create a function called `removeDuplicates` that takes in an array as a parameter and returns a new array
//     with all duplicate elements removed. The order of the elements should be preserved.

// Bonus: Feel free to come up with your own function exercises and add them to this list!

// Test your functions by calling them with different arguments and logging the results to the console.
